CoffeeFinderBegin
This project was built with C#, HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.
After initial code scaffolding was set up, the different classes were set up using (C)reate, (R)ead, (U)pdate, & (D)elete. Periodic commits were adding to the branch and then
merged with the MAIN branch. At first I was adding too many updates to each commit but then was able to break them down into more manageable pieces. Once committed I pulled them
down into the Main branch to start the next branch.
